# TactileFormer: Feature-Fused CNN-Transformer Model for Few-Shot Tactile Perception

This repository contains the implementation of **TactileFormer**, a dual-stream neural network that fuses **time-domain and frequency-domain tactile signals** for surface texture classification under both pure and impurity conditions.  
The model supports **few-shot learning**, **transfer learning (pre-train + fine-tune)**, and **classification of surfaces with liquids & granular solids**.
